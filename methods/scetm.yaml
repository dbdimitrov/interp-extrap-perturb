Description: scETM uses a standard VAE encoder with a softmax layer to obtain a cell-by-topic
  matrix, paired with a linear decoder based on matrix tri-factorisation that reconstructs
  the data from the cell-by-topic matrix, along with topics-by-embedding α, and embedding-by-genes
  ρ matrices. This structure allows the latent topics to be directly interpreted as
  groups of co-expressed genes and can optionally integrate prior pathway (prior knowledge)
  information as a binary mask.
