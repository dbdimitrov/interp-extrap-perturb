Description: CellDrift fits a negative binomial GLM to scRNA-seq counts using cell
  type, perturbation, and their interaction as independent (predictor) variables,
  while also incorporating library size and batch effects. Pairwise contrast coefficients
  are then derived to quantify the difference between perturbed and control states
  across time points. These time series of contrast coefficients, representing the
  temporal trajectory of perturbation effects per gene, are subsequently analyzed
  using Fuzzy C-means clustering to group similar temporal patterns and Functional
  PCA to extract the dominant modes of temporal variance.
