Description: 'NicheCompass, the spatial sucessor of ExpiMap, employs multiple decoders:
  one graph decoder reconstructs the spatial adjacency matrix via an adjacency loss
  to ensure that spatially-neighboring observations have similar latent representations,
  while separate (masked) decoders - one for each cellâ€™s own features and one for
  its aggregated neighborhood features - reconstruct the omics data. By masking the
  data reconstruction according to prior knowledge, each latent variable is associated
  with a gene program (subclassified according inter- or  intracellular signalling).
  Additionally, it learns de novo gene programs that capture novel, spatially coherent
  expression patterns, not covered by the prior knowledge. By default, it replaces
  the Group lasso loss of Expimap with a a dropout mechanism to prune uninformative
  prior knowledge sets.'
