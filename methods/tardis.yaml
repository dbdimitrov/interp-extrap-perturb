Description: A VAE that partitions each cellâ€™s latent representation into covariate-specific
  and covariate-agnostic (invariant) variables. It enforces disentanglement by making
  the covariate-specific latents more similar for positive pairs of cells (those sharing
  a covariate) and more dissimilar for negative pairs (those differing in that covariate).
  Simultaneously, TarDis maximizes or minimizes the distance between these positive/negative
  pairs and the covariate-agnostic latent space in a way that ensures its independence
  from the targeted covariates. This is accomplished via multiple distance-based loss
  terms for each covariate. TarDis supports both categorical and continuous covariates.
