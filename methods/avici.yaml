Description: AVICI proposes an amortized causal discovery approach, attempting to
  directly predict causal structures from observational or interventional data using
  variational inference rather than performing costly searches over possible structures.
  Since no ground truth is not available for real data, the mode is pre-trained using
  simulated data with known causal graphs and subsequently applied to real data.
