Description: DIALOGUE identifies shared multicellular patterns across cell types and
  samples. It first constructs cell-typeâ€“specific data matrices by averaging features
  (e.g., gene expression or PCs) over samples or spatial niches. Then it applies multi-factor
  sparse canonical correlation analysis (referred to as penalized matrix decomposition
  (PMD)) to derive latent feature matrices that maximize cross-cell-type correlations
  under LASSO constraints. Following this initial PMD step, DIALOGUE employs correlation
  coefficients and permutation tests to determine which cell types contribute to each
  multicellular progarmmes (MCP). It then re-applies the PMD procedure in both a multi-way
  and a pairwise fashion, incorporating programs unique to the pairwise analysis into
  the downstream modeling. Finally, gene associated with MCPs are first identified
  using partial Spearman correlation and then refined through hierarchical mixed-effects
  modeling with covariate control.
