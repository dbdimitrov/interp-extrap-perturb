Description: Bicycle addresses the challenge of robustly identifying cyclic causal
  graphs, particularly in domains like single-cell genomics, by leveraging perturbation
  data and explicitly replicating the perturbations on the graph. Following Dictys
  Bicycle assumes the perturbed cell states to be the steady-state solution of the
  Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.
