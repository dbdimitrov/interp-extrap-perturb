Description: NODAGS-Flow utilizes contractive residual flows to model perturbational
  data as generated from the steady state of a dynamical system with explicit noise.
  Following DCDI, NODAGS-Flow replicates perturbations on the graph. Further, NODAGS-Flow
  drops the acyclicity constraint to model cyclic causal models and better explain
  the feedback loops inherent to biological data.
