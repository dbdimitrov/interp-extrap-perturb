Description: 'SENA replaces discrepancy‑VAE''s encoder by using a gene-to-pathway
  mask that applies a soft weighting, via the pathway activity scores α, to the gene
  expression inputs. In this design, each weight in the encoder is elementwise multiplied
  by a mask M that assigns full weight to genes known to belong to a pathway and a
  tunable, lower weight (λ) to genes outside the pathway. This allows the model to
  primarily capture the signal of annotated genes while still letting unannotated
  genes contribute, thereby forming interpretable latent factors as linear combinations
  of pathway activities. '
