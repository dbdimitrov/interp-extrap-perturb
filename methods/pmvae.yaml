Description: 'In pmVAE, each predefined pathway is modeled as a VAE that learns a
  (local) multidimensional latent embedding for the genes in that pathway. Each VAE
  module minimizes a size-weighted local reconstruction loss based solely on its pathwayâ€™s
  genes, while the (local) latent embeddings from all pathways are concatenated to
  form a global representation. '
