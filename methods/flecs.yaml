Description: FLeCS models single-cell gene expression dynamics using coupled ordinary
  differential equations (ODEs) parameterized by a gene regulatory network. Cells
  are grouped into temporal bins either via pseudotime inference or experimental
  timestamps and aligned across time with optimal transport to form (pseudo)time
  series. To model interventions FLeCS replicates interventions in the learned graph.
