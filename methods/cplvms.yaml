Description: 'A family of contrastive Poisson latent variable models (CPLVMs), based
  on a Gamma-Poisson hierarchical generative process: - CPLVM: The variational posterior
  is approximated using log-normal distributions, preserving non-negativity in the
  latent factors. - CGLVM: Extends CPLVM by allowing latent factors to take negative
  values, replacing Gamma priors with Gaussian priors and using a log-link function
  for the Poisson rates. Variational posteriors are modeled as multivariate Gaussians.
  The authors also propose a hypothesis testing framework, in which log-(ELBO)-Bayes
  is calculated between a Null model, omitting the salient latent space, and the full
  contrastive model. This framework is used to quantify global (across all genes)
  and joint expression changes in subsets of genes (akin to gene set enrichment analysis).'
