Description: Hotspot proposes a modified autocorrelation metrics that detect genes
  with coherent expression among neighboring cells (K-nearest neighbours graph in
  a latent space, spatial proximities, or lineage). By comparing these local autocorrelation
  scores to a permutation-free null model (e.g. using negative binomial or Bernoulli
  assumptions), it calculates the significance of autocorrelated genes. Additionally,
  for module detection, Hotspot computes pairwise correlations that capture how similarly
  two genes are expressed across nearby cells and then applies hierarchical clustering
  to group genes into biologically coherent modules.
