Description: 'Decipher is a hierarchical deep generative model that integrates and
  visualises single-cell RNA-seq data from normal and perturbed conditions, identifying
  shared and disrupted cell-state trajectories. Its architecture includes dual latent
  spaces: a low-dimensional state for detailed cell-state modeling and a two-dimensional
  space for visualisation-connected to gene expression through linear or single-layer
  neural network transformations. The model aligns trajectories by maintaining shared
  transcriptional programs for common biological processes across conditions.'
