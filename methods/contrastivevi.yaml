Description: 'The successor to mmVAE introducing improvements: counts are modeled
  using a negative binomial distribution, and the MMD loss is replaced with the Wasserstein
  distance. More specifically, the Wasserstein distance is essentially calculated
  as the norm of the mean and variance of the salient latent variables of the control
  data, promoting that they approaches zero. The Wasserstein penalty is optional and
  is set to 0 (no penalty) by default'
