Description: CINEMA-OT disentangles perturbation effects from confounding variation
  by decomposing the data with independent component analysis (ICA); ICA components
  correlated with the perturbation labels are identified using Chatterjeeâ€™s coefficient
  and excluded, yielding a background (confounder) latent space that predominantly
  reflects confounding factors. Optimal transport is then applied to this background
  space to align perturbed and control cells, thereby generating counterfactual cell
  pairs, and this OT map is used in downstream analyses. They also propose a reweighting
  variant (CINEMA-OT-W) to address differential cell type abundance by pre-aligning
  treated cells with k-nearest neighbor controls and balancing clusters prior to ICA
  and optimal transport.
