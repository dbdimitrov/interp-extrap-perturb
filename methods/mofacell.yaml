Description: 'Multicellular factor analysis repurposes MOFA by treating pseudobulked
  cell types as views. Each patient is represented by multiple views - one per cell
  type - summarizing gene expression. MOFA+ ised then used to identify latent factors
  that capture coordinated variability across these views, with loadings indicating
  cell-type-specific gene contributions. '
Inspired by:
- MOFA+
Method: MOFAcell
