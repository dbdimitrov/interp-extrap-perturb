Description: Metric Flow Matching (MFM) constructs probability paths between source
  and target distributions by interpolating geodesics following a data-dependent Riemannian
  metric, ensuring that interpolations remain close to the data manifold rather than
  being straight lines in Euclidean space. MFM first learns these geodesics by minimizing
  a special cost function, and then regresses a vector field along a geodesic-based
  corrected path using a conditional flow matching objective.
