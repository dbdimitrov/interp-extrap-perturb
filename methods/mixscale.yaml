Description: Mixscale extends Mixscape by converting the binary perturbed/non-perturbed
  assignment into a continuous perturbation score. As it's predecessor, it first identifies
  DE genes between gRNA-targeted and non-targeting control cells, then computes perturbation
  vector and projects each cell’s expression profile onto this vector to yield a quantitative
  score (computed independently per cell line). A weighted multivariate regression
  is then applied where each cell’s contribution is scaled according to its perturbation
  score, so that cells with weaker perturbation (and thus lower scores) have reduced
  influence on the model. This regression also incorporates covariates such as cell
  line identity and sequencing depth, and uses a leave-one-feature-out procedure.
