Description: 'trVAE enhances the scGEN model by incorporating condition embeddings
  and leveraging maximum mean discrepancy regularisation to manage distributions across
  binary conditions. By utilizing a conditional variational autoencoder, trVAE aims
  to create a compact and consistent representation of cross-condition distributions,
  enhancing out-of-distribution prediction accuracy. '
