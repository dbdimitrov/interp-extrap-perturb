Description: scELMo first converts gene and cell metadata into textual descriptions
  and uses GPT-3.5 to generate fixed-length embeddings, which are integrated with
  normalised expression values by arithmetic or weighted averaging in a zero-shot
  framework to yield cell embeddings. For some tasks, these embeddings and are fine-tuned
  via a compact neural adaptor trained with combined classification and contrastive
  losses. These embeddings are also fed into CPA’s conditional variational autoencoder
  and GEARS’s graph neural network for perturbation response prediction
