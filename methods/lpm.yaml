Description: LPM is a decoder-only deep neural network designed for large-scale integration
  and prediction across heterogeneous perturbation datasets. LPM encodes perturbation
  (P), readout (R), and context (C) as discrete variables, each with its own embedding
  space implemented via learnable look-up tables. These embeddings are concatenated
  to and used for inference.
