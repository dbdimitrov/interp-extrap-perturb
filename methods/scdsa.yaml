Description: 'A VAE that disentangles disease (case) from healthy (control) cells
  by learning invariant background and salient space representations. The background
  and salient representations are summed to reconstruct the count data, with an (optional)
  interaction term capturing the interplay between cell type and disease. As done
  in contrastive methods, the salient representation for control cells is set to 0
  during the generative (data reconstruction) process. The invariance of the background
  latent variables is enforced through two GAN-style neural networks: one encouraging
  the prediction of cell types from the background space, while the other penalises
  the prediction of disease labels, ensuring that disease-specific information is
  isolated in the salient space.'
