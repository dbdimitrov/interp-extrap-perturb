Description: Taichi identifies perturbation-relevant cell niches in spatial omics
  data without predefined spatial clustering. It first constructs spatially-informed
  embeddings using MENDER, which are then used in a logistic regression model to predict
  slice-level condition labels. Using the trained model each cell (niche) is assigned
  a probability of belonging to the condition group. These probabilities are clustered
  using k-means (k=2) to separate condition-relevant and control-like niches. Graph
  heat diffusion is applied to refine these labels by propagating information across
  spatially adjacent cells. Finally, a second k-means clustering step is performed
  on the diffused results to define the final niche segmentation.
