Description: A modified version of PCA, where the covariance matrix (COV) is the difference
  between COV(case/perturbed) and αCOV(control/background). The hyperparameter α is
  used to balance having a high case variance and a low control variance. To provide
  some intuition, when α is 0, the model reduces to classic PCA on the case data.
  Optimal alphas (equal to k clusters) are identified using spectral clustering over
  a range of cPCA runs with different alphas, with selection based on the similarity
  of cPCA outputs.
