Description: CODEX uses a Deep Neural Network to map cells from control to perturbed
  states, learning perturbation effects in respective perturbation-dependent latent
  spaces. These latent spaces can be arbitrarily combined to infer unseen combinatorial
  effects, allowing the model to predict the outcomes of complex treatment combinations.
  Additionally, CODEX can leverage prior information from Gene Ontologies to inform
  the effects of completely unSeen Perturbation Prediction.
