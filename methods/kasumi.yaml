Description: Kasumi extends MISTy by focusing on identifying localised relationship
  patterns that are persistent across tissue samples. Instead of modeling global relationships,
  it uses a sliding-window approach to learn representations of local tissue patches
  (neighborhoods), characterized by multivariate, potentially non-linear relationships
  across views. These window-specific relationship signatures are clustered (using
  graph-based community detection) into spatial patterns, which are consistently observed
  across multiple samples. This enables Kasumi to represent each sample as a distribution
  over interpretable, shared local patterns, facilitating tasks like patient stratification
  while maintaining model explainability.
