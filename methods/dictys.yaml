Description: Dictys integrates scRNA-seq and scATAC-seq data to infer gene regulatory
  networks (GRNs) and their changes across multiple conditions. By leveraging multiomic
  data, Dictys infers context-specific networks and dynamic GRNs using steady-state
  solutions of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process to model transcriptional kinetics and
  account for feedback loops. It reconstructs GRNs by detecting transcription factor
  (TF) binding sites and refining these networks with single-cell transcriptomic data,
  capturing regulatory shifts that reflect TF activity beyond expression levels.
