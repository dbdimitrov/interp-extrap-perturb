Description: 'C2S-Scale is a family of large language models (LLMs) for single-cell
  RNA-seq analysis that extends the Cell2Sentence (C2S) framework by converting cell
  gene-expression profiles into ordered “cell sentences” for natural-language processing.Each
  C2S-Scale model is initialized from a publicly released Gemma-2 or Pythia checkpoint,
  i.e. leverages pre-existing language representations, and is then further pre-trained
  on a multimodal corpus of over a billion tokens. Each cell sentence is paired with
  the abstract (and, where available, additional free-text annotations) from the same
  study, allowing the model to learn matched transcriptomic and experimental context.'
