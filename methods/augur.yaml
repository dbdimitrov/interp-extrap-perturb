Description: Augur rank cell types by quantifying how accurately perturbation labels
  can be predicted from gene expression profiles using a random forest classifier
  (or regressor depending on the perturbation label). For each cell type, it repeatedly
  subsamples a fixed number of cells to mitigate biases from uneven cell numbers.
  It also employs a two-step feature selection procedure, first, identifying highly
  variable genes via local polynomial regression on the meanâ€“variance relationship,
  and second, random downsampling. AUGUR then uses cross-validation to compute the
  area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a model performance metric that is used to quantify
  the perturbation effect on each cell type. It also provides (gene) feature importances.
  For multi-class or continous perturbations, cell-type effects (model performance)
  are measured using macro-averaged AUC or concordance correlation coefficient, respectively.
