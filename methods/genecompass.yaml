Description: GeneCompass is a knowledge-informed, cross-species foundation model.
  During pre-training it integrates four types of prior biological knowledge - gene
  regulatory networks (ENCODE PECA2-derived GRNs), promoter sequences (fine-tuned
  DNABert embeddings), gene family annotations (gene2vec HGNC/esnembl embeddings),
  and gene co-expression relationships (Pearson Correlations in their dataset) - into
  a unified embedding space. It employs a masked-language-modeling strategy by randomly
  masking 15 % of gene inputs and simultaneously reconstructs both gene identities
  and expression values; this is optimized via a multi-task loss combining mean squared
  error for expression recovery and cross-entropy for gene ID prediction, balanced
  by a weighting hyperparameter Î². Combined with GEARS for extrapolation tasks.
