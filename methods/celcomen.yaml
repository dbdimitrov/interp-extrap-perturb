Description: Celcomen disentangles intra- and inter-cellular gene regulation in spatial
  transcriptomics data by processing gene expression through two parallel interaction
  functions. One function uses a single graph convolution layer (1-hop GNN) to learn
  a gene-gene interaction matrix that captures cross-cell signaling, while the other
  uses a linear layer to model regulation within individual cells. Training maximises
  an approximate likelihood that aligns the model-predicted weight matrices to the
  average gene expression across all cells. Simcomen then leverages these fixed, learned
  matrices to simulate spatial counterfactuals (e.g., gene knockouts) for in-silico
  experiments.
