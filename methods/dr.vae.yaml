Description: Dr.VAE uses a Variational Autoencoder architecture to predict drug response
  from transcriptomic perturbation signatures. It models transcription change as a
  linear function within a low-dimensional latent space, defined by encoder and decoder
  neural networks. For paired expression samples from treated and control conditions,
  Dr.VAE accurately predicts treated expression.
