Description: 'PDGrapher builds on graph neural network (GNN) to predict therapeutic
  perturbations that can reverse disease phenotypes, focusing directly on identifying
  perturbation targets rather than modeling the perturbation effects. By embedding
  diseased cell states into gene regulatory networks or protein-protein interaction
  networks, PDGrapher learns latent representations to infer optimal perturbations
  that drive diseased states toward desired healthy outcomes. The method utilizes
  dual GNNs - a response prediction module and a perturbagen discovery module - both
  employing causal graphs as priors and adjusting edges to model interventions. '
