Description: 'The Factorized Causal Representation (FCR) framework disentangles cell
  representations into three latent blocks: z_x, which captures context-specific (covariate)
  effects and is invariant to treatment; z_t, which encodes direct treatment effects
  and is invariant to context; and z_{tx}, which represents interactions between treatment
  and context. It additionally handles interacting covariates by using a variational
  autoencoder framework augmented with adversarial regularisation. This regularisation
  enforces the invariance of z_x across treatments and the variability of z_t with
  respect to covariates. Moreover, the conditional independence of the interaction
  term z_{tx} from both z_x and z_t, is promoted through permutation-based discriminators.'
