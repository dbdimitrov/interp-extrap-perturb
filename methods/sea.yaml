Description: SEA predicts large causal graphs by leveraging small graphs generated
  from subsets of variables using standard causal discovery algorithms like FCI or
  GIES. To tackle the challenges of causal discovery with large variable sets, SEA
  employs an amortized learning approach and utilizes a complex architecture, including
  transformer modules and diverse embeddings, to aggregate the subgraphs. SEA is pre-trained
  on synthetic data with known causal structures and encodes interventions by replicating
  the effects on the encoded graph.
