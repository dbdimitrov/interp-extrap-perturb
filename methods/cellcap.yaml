Description: CellCap is a deep generative model that extends CPA by incorporating
  cross-attention mechanisms between cell state and perturbation response (i.e., its
  basal latent space and the perturbation design matrix). Further, CellCap uses a
  variational autoencoder (VAE) framework with a linear decoder to identify sparse
  and interpretable latent factors.
Inspired by:
- CPA
- PerturbNet
Method: CellCap
Model:
- VAE
