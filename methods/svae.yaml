Description: A VAE that integrates recent advances in sparse mechanism shift modeling
  for single-cell data, inferring a causal structure where perturbation labels identify
  the latent variables affected by each perturbation. The method constructs a graph
  identifying which latent variables are influenced by specific perturbations, promoting
  disentaglement and enabling biological interpretability, such as uncovering perturbations
  affecting shared processes. A key modelling contribution is its probabilistic sparsity
  approach (relaxed straight-through Beta-Bernoulli) on the global sparse embeddings
  (graph),  improving upon its predecessor, SVAE. As such, the latent space can be
  seen as being modelled from a Spike-and-Slab prior.
