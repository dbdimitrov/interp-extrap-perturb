Description: SCCVAE combines mechanistic causal modeling with variational deep learning to predict single-cell transcriptomic responses to perturbations. It features an expression encoder that converts gene expression data from control cells into exogenous variables, a shift encoder that processes perturbation labels, a structural causal model (SCM) to represent perturbations as shift interventions, and an expression decoder.
