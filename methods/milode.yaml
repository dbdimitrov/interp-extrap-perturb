Description: miloDE is a cluster-free framework for differential expression analysis
  in scRNA-seq data that builds on Milo. Similarly, MiloDE relies on pre-calculated
  latent representations to constructs overlapping neighborhoods on a kNN graph, now
  improved using a second-order approach to better capture local transcriptional similarity.
  Expression counts are aggregated within these neighborhoods and analyzed using edgeRâ€™s
  generalised linear model framework, with dual corrections applied across genes and
  neighborhoods to control for multiple testing. Additionally, a post hoc neighborhood
  refinement step ensures complete cell coverage and computational efficiency.
