Description: MISTy extracts intra- and intercellular relationships from spatial omics
  data by learning multivariate interactions through a multi-view approach, where
  each view represents a collection of variables (e.g., a modality or an aggragation
  of a spatial niche). It jointly models spatial and functional aspects of the data,
  supporting any number of views with arbitrary numbers of variables. Target variables
  (intrinsic view) are predicted using random forests (by default), either via leave-feature-one-out
  within the intrinsic view or using the remaining (extrinsic) views.
