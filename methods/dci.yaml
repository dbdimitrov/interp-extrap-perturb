Description: DCI introduced a reformulated version of the PC algorithm. Rather than
  inferring the Causal Graph directly DCI attempts to identify causal differences
  between condition-dependent gene regulatory networks (GRNs) by focusing on edges
  that appear, disappear, or change between conditions. This significantly reduces
  the computational complexity in comparison to the original PC algorithm.
