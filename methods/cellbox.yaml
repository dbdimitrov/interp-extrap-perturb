Description: 'CellBox models cellular responses to perturbations, by linking molecular
  and phenotypic outcomes through a unified nonlinear ODE-based model, aimed at simulating
  dynamic cellular behavior. The framework uses gradient descent with automatic differentiation
  to infer ODE network interaction parameters, facilitating exposure to novel perturbations
  and prediction of cell responses. '
