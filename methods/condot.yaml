Description: 'CondOT builds on CellOT to learn context-aware optimal transport maps
  by conditioning on an auxiliary variable. Instead of learning a fixed transport
  map, it learns a context-dependent transport map that adapts based on this auxiliary
  information. The OT map is modeled as the gradient of a convex potential using partially
  input convex neural networks, which ensures mathematical properties required for
  parametrised optimal transport. The auxiliary variables can be of different types:
  continuous (like dosage or spatial coordinates), categorical (like treatment groups,
  represented via one-hot encoding), or learned embeddings learned. Additionally,
  CondOT includes a separate neural module, a combinator network, for combinatorial
  predictions.'
