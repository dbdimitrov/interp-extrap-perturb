Description: 'DCD-FG leverages a Gaussian low-rank structural equation model to model
  factor directed acyclic graphs (f-DAGs). The f-DAG assumption posits that many nodes
  share a similar set of parents and children, reflecting the behavior of genes acting
  collectively in biological programs. This method restricts the search space to low-rank
  causal interactions to improve causal discovery accuracy and scalability for high-dimensional
  data. '
