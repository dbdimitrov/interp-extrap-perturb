Description: SpatialDIVA learns distinct latent spaces capturing intrinsic (transcriptomic),
  morphological (histology), spatial neighborhood, technical (batch), and residual
  variations. To promote disentanglement, the model employs auxiliary classification
  heads - using cell type labels to supervise the transcriptomic latent space, pathology
  annotations to guide the histology latent space, and batch labels to capture technical
  variation. Additionally, an auxiliary regression head with mean squared error (MSE)
  loss is trained to ensure that the spatial latent space accurately reconstructs
  a PCA-based representation derived from concatenated histology and transcriptomic
  profiles from k-nearest spatial neighbours, thereby capturing both imaging and expression
  data from adjacent spots.
