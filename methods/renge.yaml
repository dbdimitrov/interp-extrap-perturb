Description: RENGE attempts to infer gene regulatory networks from time-series single-cell
  CRISPR knockout data. It models changes in gene expression following a knockout
  by propagating the effects through direct and higher-order (indirect) regulatory
  paths, where the gene network is represented as a matrix of regulatory strengths
  between gene pairs.
