Description: 'PRnet is a generative framework to predict the transcriptional response
  of cells to chemical perturbations. To learn the respose, the model randomly assigns
  control and perturbed cell pairs which are conditioned on the smiles embedding of
  the chemical perturbation and the dose. PRnet consists of three components: Perturb-adapter,
  Perturb-encoder, and Perturb-decoder, which work together to generate a distribution
  of transcriptional responses. Changing the smiles embedding can be used to predict
  the response of cells to novel chemical perturbations at both bulk and single-cell
  levels.'
