Description: A VAE  that combines the sparse mechanism shift from SVAE+ with learning
  a probabilistic pairing between cells and unobserved auxiliary variables. These
  auxilary variables correspond to the observed perturbation labels in SVAE+, but
  here they are learned in a data-driven way (rather than passed as static labels)
  which in turn enables counterfactual context-transfer scenarios.
