Description: 'DAG-GNN introduced a polynomial alternative for the acyclicity constraint
  of NOTEARS, and encodes the DAG in a Graph Neural Network. Experimental results
  on synthetic data sets indicate that DAG-GNN learns more accurate graphs for non-linearly
  generated samples. '
Inspired by:
- NOTEARS
Method: DAG-GNN
