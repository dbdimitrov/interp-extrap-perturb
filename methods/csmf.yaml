Description: A non-negative matrix factorisation that decomposes gene expression matrices
  into common and condition-specific patterns. For each condition, the observed expression
  matrix is approximated as the sum of a common component - represented by a common
  feature matrix with condition-specific coefficient matrices - and a specific component
  unique to each condition, represented by its own feature matrix  and coefficients.
  The model uses an alternating approach to minimize the combined reconstruction error
  (squared Frobenius norm) across common and shared components.
