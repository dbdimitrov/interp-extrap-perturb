Description: scGenePT combines CRISPR single-cell RNA-seq perturbation data with language-based
  gene embeddings. It builds on a pretrained scGPT by adding gene-level text embeddings
  from NCBI Gene/UniProt summaries or GO annotations, to the token, count, and perturbation
  embeddings of the model during fine-tuning on perturbational data.
