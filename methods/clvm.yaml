Description: 'A family of contrastive latent variable models (cLVMs), where case data
  are modeled as the sum of background and salient latent embeddings, while control
  data are reconstructed solely from background embeddings: - cLVM with Gaussian likelihoods
  and priors - Sparse cLVM with horseshoe prior used to regularize the weights - Robust
  cLVM with a Student''s t distribution - cLVM with automatic relevance determination
  to regularise the columns of the weight matrix - contrastive VAE, as a non-linear
  extension of the framework The shared concept across these models is that each model
  learns a shared set of latent variables for the background and target data, while
  salient latent variables are learnt solely for the target data.'
