Description: A VAE that learns disentangled latent representations in an unsupervised
  manner by employing additive decoders followed by a nonlinear pooling function (by
  default, log-sum-exp pooling). The decoder splits the latent vector into K variables,
  each decoded separately, and then aggregates these outputs. This architecture enforces
  disentanglement under theoretical assumptions, such as the additivity of independent
  processes, the existence of process-specific gene markers, and reconstruction quality,
  ensuring that distinct biological processes map to different latent dimensions.
  Additionally, DRVI performs batch-correction by optionally incorporating covariate
  information. Finally, DRVI enables the of ranking latent dimensions based on reconstruction
  and providing a gene interpretability pipeline via latent variable perturbations.
