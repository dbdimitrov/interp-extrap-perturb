Description: SALT & PEPER represents a straightforward two-step approach. The initial
  SALT model assumes additive effects of individual perturbations. Building on this
  foundation, PEPER leverages a neural network to learn a non-linear correction, effectively
  accounting for non-additive combinatorial effects. Notably, despite its simplicity,
  this approach has demonstrated impressive performance on standard extrapolation
  benchmarks.
