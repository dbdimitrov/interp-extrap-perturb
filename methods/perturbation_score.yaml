Description: Perturbation Score (PS) quantifies single-cell responses to ("dosage"-informed)
  perturbations in three steps. First, a signature gene set is defined for each perturbation
  - either via differential expression or pre-defined gene sets. Second, scMAGeCK’s
  regression framework estimates gene-level coefficients (β) reflecting the average
  effect of each perturbation on its target genes. Third, a regularised regression
  model is fitted per cell to estimate a scalar PS [0-to-1], reflecting how well the
  cell’s gene expression profile matches the β-weighted perturbation signature. This
  is done through constrained optimisation, where scores are inferred only for cells
  annotated as receiving the perturbation.
