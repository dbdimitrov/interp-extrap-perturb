Description: MUSIC evaluates sgRNA knockout efficiency and summarises perturbation
  effects using topic modeling. Following preprocessing steps, MUSIC removes low-efficiency
  (non-targeted) cells based on the cosine similarity of their differential expression
  genes, excluding perturbed cells with profiles more similar to controls. Next, highly
  dispersed DE genes are selected and their normalised expression values are used
  as to fit a topic model, where cells are treated as documents and gene counts as
  words. Topics are then ranked according to overall effect, their relevance to each
  perturbation, and perturbation similarities.
