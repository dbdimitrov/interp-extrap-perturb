Description: 'SIMVI is a spatially-informed VAE that disentangles gene expression
  variability into two latent factors: an intrinsic variable z, which captures cell
  typeâ€“specific signals, and a spatial variable s, which quantifies spatial effects.
  The spatial latent variable s is inferred by aggregating the intrinsic representations
  of neighboring cells via a Graph Attention Network, thereby incorporating local
  spatial context. To promote independence between z and s, SIMVI employs an asymmetric
  regularisation on z using maximum mean discrepancy or, alternatively, a  mutual
  information estimator, ensuring that z retains minimal non-cell-intrinsic information.
  Furthermore, leveraging debiased machine learning principles, the model decomposes
  gene expression variance by treating s as a continuous treatment and z as confounding
  covariates, thereby quantifying the specific impact of spatial context on gene expression.'
