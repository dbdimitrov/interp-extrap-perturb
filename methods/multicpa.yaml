Description: MultiCPA extends CPA to predict combinatorial perturbation responses
  from CITE-seq data by integrating gene and protein modalities using either concatenation
  or a product of experts. It employs totalVI-inspired decoders and likelihoods to
  model modality-specific outputs.
Inspired by:
- CPA (theirs)
Method: MultiCPA
Model:
- AE framework inspired by CPA
- totalVI likelihood
