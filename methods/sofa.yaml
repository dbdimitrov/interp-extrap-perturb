Description: A Group Factor Analysis for multi-omics data that separates latent variables
  into guided factors, linked to predefined (observed) variables, and unguided factors.
  This structure ensures that each observed variable (known biological and technical
  effects) is captured by a corresponding guided factor, disentangling the observed
  variables from the residual information, which is in turn captured by the unguided
  factors. Additionally, SOFA works with both continous and categorical guiding variables
  and it employs a hierarchical horseshoe prior on loading weights, applying adaptive
  shrinkage at the view, factor, and feature levels.
