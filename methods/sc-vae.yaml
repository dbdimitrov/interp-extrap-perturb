Description: A VAE that combines the contrastiveVI/cVAE architecture with a classifier
  that learns the pairing of perturbation labels to cells. As in ContrastiveVI, unperturbed
  cells are drawn solely from background latent space, while cells classified as perturbed
  are reconstructed from both the background and salient sapces. Additionally, Hilbert-Schmidt
  Independence Criterion (HSIC) is used to disentagle the background and salient latent
  spaces.
Inspired by:
- ContrastiveVI
