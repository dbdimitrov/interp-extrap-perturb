Description: ontoVAE uses a multi-layer, linear decoder, structured to represent hierarchical
  prior knowledge - e.g. layers can represent gene ontology level.  To preserve connections
  beyond adjacent layers, the decoder concatenates outputs from previous layers with
  the current layer’s input, with binary masks ensuring that only valid parent–child
  and gene set relationships are captured. Decoder weights are constrained to be positive
  to preserve directional pathway activity, with each ontology term represented by
  three neurons whose average activation reflects its activity.
