Description: AttentionPert is a complex generative model that utilizes attention-based
  mechanisms to reconstruct perturbed cellular profiles from perturbation condition
  and precomputed Gene2Vec embeddings. It uses two encoders to capture global and
  local relationships between genes and perturbations (following GEARS). The PertWeight
  encoder models attention-based interactions between perturbations, while the PertLocal
  encoder identifies localized perturbation effects using an augmented GO graph.
