Description: DCDI advanced DAG learning by introducing a framework for causal discovery
  using interventional data. DCDI encoding interventions using a binary adjacency
  matrix, to replicate the interventional effects directly the DAG and uses neural
  networks to model the conditional densities. Further, the authors provided theoretical
  guarantees for DAG learning using interventional data and showed that the inferred
  graphs can scale to 100 nodes.
