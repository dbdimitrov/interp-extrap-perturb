Description: MichiGAN is a two-step approach that first uses a Î²-TCVAE - a variant
  of the variational autoencoder that penalizes total correlation among latent variables
  to promote disentangled representations. These latent representations (posterior
  means or samples) are then used to condition a Wasserstein GAN, the generator of
  which similarly to the VAE reconstructs the data from the latent variables, while
  attempting to 'fool' a discriminator whether the samples were real or generated.
  Counterfactual predictions are done via latent space arithmetics as in scGEN.
