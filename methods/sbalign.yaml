Description: SBALIGN solves a Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Problem with aligned data,
  i.e. where each sample from the source distribution is paired with a corresponding
  sample from the target distribution. It combines classical SB theory with Doob's
  h-transform to derive a novel loss -- parameterizing the drift and h-function with
  neural networks, enabling more stable training than iterative procedures.
