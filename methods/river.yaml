Description: River identifies condition-relevant genes from spatial omics data across
  multiple slices or conditions. It learns gene expression and spatial coordinate
  embeddings using separate MLP-based encoders, which are then concatenated and used
  to predict condition labels. Spatial alignment is thus required as a preprocessing
  step. In a second step, River uses Integrated Gradients, DeepLift, and GradientShap
  to attribute model predictions to input genes at the cell level. These attribution
  scores are aggregated using rank aggregation to prioritize condition-relevant genes.
