Description: Waddington-OT models developmental processes as time-varying  probability
  distributions in gene expression space and infers temporal couplings by solving
  an entropy-regularized, unbalanced optimal transport problem. Growth rate, estimated
  leveraging expression levels of genes associated with proliferation and apoptosis,
  is taken into consideration via unbalanced OT. Additionally, uses spectral clustering
  to obtain Gene Programmes, and subsequently associate those to predictive TFs.
