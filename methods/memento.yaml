Description: Memento is a differential expression framework that uses method-of-moments
  estimators under a multivariate hypergeometric model, where a geneâ€™s mean is derived
  from Good-Turing corrected counts scaled by total cell counts. Differential variability
  is quantified as the variance remaining after accounting for mean-dependent effects
  (residual variance), while the covariance (pairwise association) between genes is
  estimated from the off-diagonal elements of the resulting variance-covariance matrix.
  Efficient permutation is achieved through a bootstrapping strategy that leverages
  the sparsity of unique transcript counts.
