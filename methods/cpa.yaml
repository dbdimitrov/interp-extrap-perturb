Description: 'Compositional Perturbation Autoencoder (CPA) models single-cell gene
  expression under perturbations and covariates by decomposing expression into additive
  latent embeddings: a basal state, perturbation effects, and covariate effects. To
  ensure that the basal embedding is disentangled from perturbations and covariates,
  CPA employs an adversarial training scheme: auxiliary classifiers are trained to
  predict perturbations and covariates from the basal embedding, while the encoder
  is updated using a combined loss that discourages the basal representation from
  encoding such information. Perturbation embeddings are modulated by neural networks
  applied to continuous covariates (e.g., dose or time), enabling modeling of dose-response
  and combinatorial effects. '
