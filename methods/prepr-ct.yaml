Description: PrePR-CT is a framework designed to predict transcriptional responses
  to chemical perturbations in unobserved cell types by utilizing cell-type-specific
  graphs encoded within Graph Attention Networks (GANs). The approach constructs cell
  graph priors using metacells which are randomly associated with perturbed cells
  to transform the problem into a regression task.
