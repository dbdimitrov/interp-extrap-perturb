Description: Prophet represents each experiment as a set of three axes - cellular
  state (cell lines), treatments (perturbations), and phenotypic readouts - and projects
  diverse prior knowledge types (e.g., CCLE bulk RNA-seq for cell lines; chemical
  fingerprints or transcriptomic/genomic vectors for perturbations; learnable embeddings
  for readouts) into a shared token space. It is pre-trained on a set of diverse perturbation
  experiments covering readouts such as cell viability, compound IC50, Cell Painting
  morphology features, mRNA transcript abundance, and cell type proportions. A transformer-based
  encoder integrates these tokenised inputs, feeding a regression head thatâ€™s trained
  end-to-end to minimise mean squared error across all outcome types. The model is
  fine-tuned for assay-specific data applications.
