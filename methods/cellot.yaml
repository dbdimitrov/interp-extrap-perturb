Description: CellOT learns mappings between control and perturbed cell state distributions
  by solving a dual formulation of the optimal transport problem. The approach learns
  optimal transport maps as the gradient of a convex potential function, which is
  approximated using input convex neural networks - (briefly) a specific type of neural
  network with convex-preserving constraints, such as non-negative weights and a predefined
  set of activation functions (e.g. ReLU). Instead of relying on regularisation-based
  OT (e.g. Entropy-regularised Sinkhorn), it jointly optimizes dual potentials (a
  pair of functions) via a maxâ€“min loss.
