Description: scPreGAN is a deep generative model that predicts the response of single-cell
  expression to perturbation by integrating an autoencoder and a generative adversarial
  network. The model extracts common information from unperturbed and perturbed data
  using an encoder network, and then generates perturbed data using a generator network.
  scPreGAN outperforms state-of-the-art methods on three real world datasets, capturing
  the complicated distribution of cell expression and generating prediction data with
  the same expression abundance as real data.
