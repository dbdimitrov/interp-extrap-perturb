Description: 'Iterpert is an active learning framework for Perturb-seq experiments
  that uses GEARS to predict gene expression gene expression perturbation effects.
  The method iteratively retrains GEARS on new data and selects the next batch of
  perturbations using an enhanced kernel, which is constructed by fusing the GEARS-derived
  kernel with kernels from six prior information sources (additional Perturb-seq data,
  optical pooled screens, scRNA-seq atlases, protein structures, proteinâ€“protein interaction
  networks, and literature-derived features). Each prior source is mapped into a kernel
  matrix, normalized, and combined with the model kernel via a mean fusion operator.
  The fused kernel is then used with a greedy distance maximisation rule to select
  perturbation batches under budget constraints (a limited set of experiments per
  round). '
