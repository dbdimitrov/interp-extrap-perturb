Description: PRESCIENT models cellular differentiation as a stochastic diffusion process,
  where the drift term is parameterised as the negative gradient of a neural network-learned
  potential function. The model is trained using time-series single-cell RNA-seq data,
  and fits the potential function by minimizing the regularised Wasserstein distance
  between simulated and observed cell populations at each time point, explicitly incorporating
  cell proliferation by weighting cells according to their expected number of descendants.
  PRESCIENT can simulate differentiation trajectories for both observed and (in silico)
  perturbed cell states, enabling the prediction of cell fate outcomes under various
  genetic interventions.
