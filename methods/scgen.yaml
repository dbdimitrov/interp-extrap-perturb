Description: 'scGen is VAE that uses latent space vector arithmetics to predict single-cell
  perturbation responses. The method first encodes high-dimensional gene expression
  profiles into a latent space, where it computes a difference vector (delta) representing
  the change between perturbed and unperturbed conditions. At inference, this delta
  vector is linearly added to the latent representation of unperturbed cells, and
  the adjusted latent vector is then decoded back into the original gene expression
  space, thereby simulating the perturbed state. '
