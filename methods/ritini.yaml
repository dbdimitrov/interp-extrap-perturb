Description: RiTINI employs graph ordinary differential equations (graph-ODEs) to
  infer time-varying interaction graphs from multivariate time series data. RiTINI
  integrates dual attention mechanisms to enhance dynamic modeling and defines interaction
  graph inference as identifying a directed graph. Further, RiTINI utilizes prior
  knowledge to initialise the causal graph and by penalizing deviations the prior.
  Additionally, RiTINI simulates perturbations in silico to further refine the graph
  structure.
