Description: cycle CDR uses a Cycle Consistent Learning strategy with a Complex AE
  architecture, consisting of two Encoder-Decoder pairs, to reconstruct control and
  perturbed samples. The two submodels are used in an alternating order to reconstruct
  the perturbed samples, and a GAN loss is applied to remove irrelevant information
  in the latent space. Additionally, chemical representations are added to the latent
  representation of each submodel to enhance the model's ability to capture chemical
  information.
