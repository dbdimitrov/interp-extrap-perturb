Description: A non-negative matrix factorisation method that decomposes single-cell
  gene expression data into common and condition-specific gene modulees. Each sample’s
  expression matrix is modeled as the sum of a shared component (W₂V) and condition-specific
  components (W₁Hⱼ), plus residual noise. The approach minimizes a loss function combining
  reconstruction error (Frobenius norm) with regularisation terms that control module
  scale and inter-condition similarity.
