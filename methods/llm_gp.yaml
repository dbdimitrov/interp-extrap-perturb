Description: 'The method embeds each gene using two LLM-derived representations -
  GPT-3.5 text embeddings of NCBI gene descriptions and ProtT5 protein sequence embeddings;
  and, after reducing them to the top 50 principal components, uses these as inputs
  to a multi-output Gaussian Process regression model with an RBF kernel to predict
  the differential expression response to single-gene knockouts. '
