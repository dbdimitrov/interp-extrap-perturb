Description: GEDI learns a shared latent space and, for each sample, estimates a specific
  reconstruction function that maps latent states to observed gene expression profiles.
  This design captures inter-sample variability and enables differential expression
  analysis along continuous cell-state gradients without relying on predefined clusters.
  Optionally, it can incorporate prior knowledge.
Inspired by:
- PLIER (PK representation)
Method: GEDI
Model:
- Probabilistic
- Sample-specific Decoders
- PK Representations (optional)
- RNA Velocity (optional)
