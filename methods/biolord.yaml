Description: A deep generative model that disentangles (multi-omics) single-cell data
  by separating sources of variation into known and unknown decomposed latent spaces,
  which are then concatenated for reconstruction. It requires partial supervision
  through known cell attributes, such as cell type, age, or perturbation, and employs
  different encoding strategies for categorical and continuous attributes. Biolord
  maximizes reconstruction accuracy using count likelihoods, along with an additional
  MSE loss, while minimizing information in the unknown the per-cell embeddings, thus
  promoting effective disentanglement. To further constrain the unknown latent space,
  Biolord uses activation penalty (L2) and Gaussian noise.
