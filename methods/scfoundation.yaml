Description: 'scFoundation uses an asymmetric transformer encoder–decoder: its embedding
  module converts each continuous gene expression scalar directly into a high-dimensional
  learnable vector without discretisation; the encoder takes as input only nonzero
  and unmasked embeddings through vanilla transformer blocks to model gene–gene dependencies
  efficiently. The zero and masked gene embeddings, along with the encoder embeddings,
  are passed to the decoder, which uses Performer-style attention to reconstruct transcriptome-wide
  representations, specifically those of masked genes. Specifically, scFoundation
  is trained using a masked regression objective on both raw and downsampled count
  vectors, with two total-count tokens concatenated to inputs to account for sequencing
  depth variance. The decoder-derived gene context embeddings are then used as node
  features in GEARS for single-cell perturbation response prediction.'
