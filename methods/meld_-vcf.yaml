Description: MELD models cells as samples drawn from a probability density defined
  in a low-dimensional space (manifold). Each cell is assigned to a one-hot indicator
  according to its sample origin (e.g. treatment or control), normalised by the total
  cell count in that sample. A cell (transcriptomic) similarity graph is then built
  using a decaying kernel, and the normalised indicator vectors are smoothed across
  the graph, such that each cellâ€™s value is updated by averaging with its neighbors
  to yield a density estimate for each sample (condition) for that cell. Normalizing
  these estimates produces a perturbation-associated relative likelihood for each
  cell. Vertex Frequency Clustering (VFC) then uses these likelihoods, cell indicator
  vectors, and similarity graphs to cluster cells with similar transcriptomics and
  perturbation profiles.
