Description: scRank infers cell type-specific Gene Programmes from untreated scRNA-seq
  data by constructing co-expression networks via principal component regression with
  random subsampling and integrating them using tensor decomposition. It simulates
  drug perturbation by modifying the drug targets' outgoing edges to generate an in-sillico
  perturbed network, and then aligns the untreated and perturbed networks via Laplacian
  eigen-decomposition. In this low-dimensional space, the distances between corresponding
  gene nodes quantify gene-level changes due to the perturbation. These distances,
  weighted by network connectivity (e.g., outgoing edge strength normalised by node
  degree) and extended through two-hop diffusion, are aggregated to yield a composite
  perturbation score that ranks cell types by their predicted drug responsiveness.
