Description: Squidiff integrates a diffusion model with a variational autoencoder
  (VAE) to modulating cellular states and conditions using latent variables. Squidiff
  can accurately capture and reproduce cellular states, and can be used to generate
  new single-cell gene expression data over time and in response to stimuli
Inspired by:
- Diffusion
