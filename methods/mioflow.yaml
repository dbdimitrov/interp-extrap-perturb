Description: MIOFlow learns (stochastic) continuous dynamics from snapshot data by
  combining neural ODEs, manifold learning, and optimal transport. The method first
  trains a Geodesic Autoencoder to embed data into a latent space where geodesic-based
  distances are preserved, then models trajectories via a neural ODE and an ODE solver,
  and optimizes the Wasserstein loss between actual and predicted distributions.
