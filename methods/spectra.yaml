Description: Spectra decomposes a gene expression matrix into cell-by-factor and factor-by-gene
  matrices, while integrating prior knowledge gene sets and cell-type labels. It explicitly
  models both global and cell-type–specific factors by incorporating cell-type labels,
  thereby disentagling the typically dominating cell-type variation from shared Gene
  Programmes. Gene sets are represented as a gene–gene knowledge graph, and a penalty
  term based on a weighted Bernoulli likelihood, guides the factorisation toward preserving
  this graph. Yet, it also permits the data-driven discovery of novel programs by
  'detaching' factors from the prior. Spectra can also include cell-type-specific
  prior knowledge gene sets (e.g. T cell antigen receptor activation programmes can
  be limited to T cells)
