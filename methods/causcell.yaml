Description: CausCell integrates causal representation learning with diffusion-based
  generative modeling to generate counterfactual single-cell data. It disentangles
  observed and unobserved concepts using concept-specific adversarial discriminators
  and links the resulting latent representations through a structural causal model
  encoded as a directed acyclic graph.
