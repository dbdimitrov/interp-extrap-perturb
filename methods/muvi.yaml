Description: MuVI is a multi-view factor analysis that encodes prior knowledge by
  imposing structured sparsity on view-specific factor loadings via a weighted, regularized
  horseshoe prior. Specifically, it uses a weight parameter that controls the variance
  of each loading; e.g., by default, it is set to 0.99 for genes known to belong to
  a gene set and 0.01 for genes which do not (are uknown). Using this hieararchical
  regulairisation strategy, MuVI directly associates latent factors with corresponding
  gene sets while still allowing for the de novo identification of additional genes
  relevant to a given factor.
