Description: The paper extends entropic Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport and Co-Optimal
  Transport to incorporate perturbation labels for aligning data across different
  modalities from large-scale perturbation screens. The core innovation involves constraining
  the learned cross-modality coupling matrix to be "label-compatible", meaning that
  the transport plan is informed by the perturbation labels and is only allowed to
  match between cells that have received the same perturbation label, which is achieved
  by modifying the Sinkhorn algorithm. This label-compatible alignment is used to
  train a model to estimate cellular responses to perturbations when measurements
  are available in only one modality.
