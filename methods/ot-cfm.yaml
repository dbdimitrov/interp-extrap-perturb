Description: 'The paper introduces two key Flow Matching variants: (i) Optimal Transport
  CFM (OT-CFM), which uses optimal transport couplings (approximated with minibatch
  OT), to produce more robust flow inference and (ii) Schrödinger Bridge CFM solving
  the Schrödinger Bridge problem by using entropy-regularized OT couplings. '
