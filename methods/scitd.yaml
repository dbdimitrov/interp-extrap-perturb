Description: scITD constructs a three-dimensional tensor (donors × genes × cell types)
  by generating donor-by-gene pseudobulk matrices for each cell type. Tucker decomposition
  then decomposes this tensor into separate factor matrices for donors, genes, and
  cell types, along with a core tensor that captures their interactions as latent
  multicellular expression patterns. The gene factors and core tensor are rearranged
  into a loading tensor analogous to PCA loadings, while the donor factor matrix represents
  sample scores. Finally, to improve interpretability, a two-step rotation is carried
  out - first applying ICA to the gene factors and then varimax to the donor factors.
