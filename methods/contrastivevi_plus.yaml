Description: An extension of ContrastiveVI that incorporates an auxiliary classifier
  to estimate the effects of perturbations, where the classifier operates on the salient
  variables and is sampled from a relaxed straight-through Bernoulli distribution.
  The output from the classifier also directly informs the salient latent space, indicating
  whether a cell expressing a gRNA successfully underwent a corresponding genetic
  perturbation. Additionally, Wasserstein distance is replaced by KL divergence, encouraging
  non-perturbed cells to map to the null region of the salient space. For datasets
  with a larger number of perturbations, the method also re-introduces and minimizes
  the Maximum Mean Discrepancy between the salient and background latent variables.
  This discourages the leakage of perturbation-induced information into the background
  latent variables, ensuring a clearer separation of perturbation effects.
