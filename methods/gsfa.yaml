Description: GSFA is a two-layer, guided Factor Analysis model that quantifies the
  effects of genetic perturbations on latent factors. The model first factorizes the
  expression matrix Y into a factor matrix Z (normal prior) and gene loadings W (normal-mixture
  prior). Then, it captures the effect (β) of perturbation on factors using multivariate
  linear regression. Spike-and-slab prior is used to enforce sparsity on β, which
  can also analogously be seen as a causal graph. The linearity of GSFA further enables
  perturbation-associated, differentially-expressed genes to be identified. GSFA uses
  Gibbs sampling for inference.
