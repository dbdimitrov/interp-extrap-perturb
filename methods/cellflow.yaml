Description: CellFlow learns a vector field to predict time-dependent expression profiles
  under diverse conditions. The model encodes various covariates (perturbation, dosage,
  batch, etc.), aggregates the embeddings via attention and deep sets, and uses a
  conditional flow matching framework to learn the underlying flow of the effect.
