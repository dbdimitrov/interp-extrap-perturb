Description: 'LEMUR is a PCA based algorithm that defines condition dependent embedings
  to analyze differences in differentialy expressed genes across conditions. For each
  condition a separate embeding matrix is learned and reconstructed using a shared
  matrix. This is used to generate counterfactual estimates for each cell and condition,
  which is used to infer label-free DE genes and neighborhoods. '
