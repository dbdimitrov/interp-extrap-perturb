Description: 'scPRAM is a computational framework for predicting single-cell gene
  expression changes in response to perturbations. The method integrates three main
  components: a variational autoencoder (VAE), optimal transport, and an attention
  mechanism. The VAE encodes the gene expression data into a latent space. Optimal
  transport is applied in this latent space to match unpaired cells before and after
  perturbation by finding an optimal coupling between their distributions. For each
  test cell, the attention mechanism computes a perturbation vector by comparing its
  latent representation (query) against those of matched training cells (keys and
  values). The predicted post-perturbation response is generated by adding the perturbation
  vector to the query and decoding it back to gene expression space using the VAE
  decoder.'
