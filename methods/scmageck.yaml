Description: 'scMAGeCK is a framework with two modules: 1) scMAGeCK-RRA ranks cells
  by marker expression and uses rank aggregation, with a dropout filtering step, to
  detect enrichment of specific perturbations; 2) scMAGeCK-LR applies ridge regression
  on the expression matrix to compute the relevance of perturbations, including in
  cells with multiple perturbations. Both modules rely on permutation tests and Benjamini-Hochberg
  correction.'
