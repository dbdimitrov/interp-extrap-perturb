Description: scPRINT is a bidirectional transformer focused for scalable zero-shot
  inference on new scRNA-seq datasets. It is pre-trained with a composite loss that
  combines the denoising of downsampled transcripts via a zero-inflated negative-binomial
  decoder, reconstruction of full expression profiles from bottleneck embeddings,
  and hierarchical label prediction that disentangles latent factors such as cell
  type, disease state and sequencing platform. Gene tokens merge a learned protein
  embedding for the gene ID, an MLP-encoded log-normalised count and a positional
  encoding of its genomic locus. Pre-training contexts sample 2,200 randomly selected
  expressed genes per cell (+ padded with unexpressed genes). At inference, cell-specific
  gene networks are extracted from multi-head attention maps either by averaging all
  heads or by selecting subsets post hoc based on their correlation with external
  priors (e.g., PPI databases, ChIP-seq, perturbation-ground-truth networks).
