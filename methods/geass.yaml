Description: 'GEASS is a causal feature selection framework in high-dimensional spatal
  & temporal omics data that identifies nonlinear Granger causal interactions by maximizing
  a sparsity-regularised modified transfer entropy. It enforces sparsity using combinatorial
  stochastic gate layers that allow it to select a minimal subset of features with
  causal interactions - i.e. two sets of of non-overlapping genes as drivers (source)
  and receivers (sink). '
Inspired by:
- Transfer Entropy
Method: GEASS
