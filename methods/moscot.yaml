Description: Moscot is a broad and scalable framework that recasts various single-cell
  mapping tasks as optimal transport problems, supporting formulations that compare
  distributions in shared (Wasserstein-type OT), distinct (Gromov-Wasserstein OT),
  and partially-overlapping feature spaces (fused-Gromovâ€“Wasserstein OT). Beyond Entropy-regularized
  sinkhorn (Cuturi et al., 2013), moscot provides a user-friendly API to more recent
  OT strategies, such as low-rank and sparse Monge maps.
