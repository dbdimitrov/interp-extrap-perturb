Description: 'VAE model, which incorporates technical and biological covariates into
  two sets of latent variables:  - Z_I embeds biologically-relevant variables - Z_B
  embeds the unwanted variability in the data (i.e. batch effect labels) These are
  then fed into a shared encoder, along with the count data. The output of this shared
  encoder is fed to the decoder. Optionally, further disentanglement of the two latent
  variable sets is achieved by minimizing their total correlation, which is approximated
  via a minibatch-weighted estimator that quantifies the difference between the joint
  posterior and the product of individual marginal distributions.'
