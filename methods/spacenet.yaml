Description: SpaCeNet aims to untangle the complex relationships between molecular
  interactions within and between cells by analyzing spatially resolved single-cell
  data. To achieve this, SpaCeNet leverages an adaptation of probabilistic graphical
  models  to enable spatially resolved conditional independence testing. This approach
  allows for the identification of direct and indirect dependencies, as well as the
  removal of spurious gene association patterns. Additionally, SpaCeNet incorporates
  explicit cell-cell distance information to differentiate between short- and long-range
  interactions, thereby distinguishing between baseline cellular variability and interactions
  influenced by a cell's microenvironment.
