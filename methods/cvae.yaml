Description: 'VAE with two sets of latent variables (two encoders): salient and background,
  each learned using amortised inference from both case and control observations,
  respectively. The latent variables are concatenated and then decoded simultaneously
  via a shared decoder. During the generative process (decoding), the control observations
  are reconstructed solely from the background latent space, with salient latent variables
  being set to 0, while the case observations are generated from both sets of latent
  variables. Optionally, the two sets of latent variables can be further disentagled
  by minimizing their total correlation, in practice done by training a discriminator
  to distinguish real from permuted latent samples.'
