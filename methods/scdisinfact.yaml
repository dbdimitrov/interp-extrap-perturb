Description: A VAE that encodes shared-bio latent factors that capture biological
  variation (e.g. cell-type differences) and unshared-bio factors that capture condition-specific
  signals via separate encoders. Shared factors follow a standard normal prior, while
  unshared factors use a condition-specific Gaussian mixture prior. The invariance
  of the shared latent variables is enforced via an MMD penalty, while conditon-encoding
  in the unshared latent variables is promoted via a classification penalty. Group
  lasso is used to regularise condition-specific encoders, and it's (penalty) weights
  are used to select key genes per condition. scDisInFac enables perturbation predictions
  in multi-batch, multi-condition settings using scGEN-style arithmetics on the unshared
  space.
