Description: 'Vespucci builds on Augur, and similarly it trains a random forest classifier
  to predict perturbation labels based on gene expression but extends this to spatial
  barcodes, using cross-validation within small, neighbouring regions to compute the
  area under the ROC curve (AUC) as a measure of transcriptional separability per
  observation. To overcome the computational inefficiency of classification across
  all observations, Vespucci employs a meta-learning approach: it first performs exhaustive
  classification on a subset of barcodes, then trains a random forrest regression
  model on derived distance metrics (e.g., Pearson correlation, Spearman correlation)
  between all pairs of observations to impute AUCs across the full dataset. This is
  done by iteratively expanding the number of observations in the training set until
  convergence (according to prediction similarity to the previous iteration). Finally,
  perturbation-responsive genes are identified by splitting the data (using an independent
  set of observations) to avoid bias, then using negative binomial mixed models to
  link gene expression to AUC scores.'
