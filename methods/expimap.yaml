Description: Expimap uses a nonlinear encoder and a masked linear decoder, where the
  latent spaceâ€™s dimensions are set equal to the number of gene programs, and decoder
  weights are masked according to prior knowledge to ensure that each latent variable
  reconstructs only genes associated with the geneset (fixed membership), with L1
  sparsity regularisation allowing soft membership for additional genes, not included
  in the prior knowledge. Group lasso is additionally used to 'deactivate' uniformative
  Gene Programmes.
