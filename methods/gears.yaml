Description: GEARS is uses graph neural networks to learn multidimensional embeddings
  for genes and their perturbations by respectively leveraging gene co-expression
  and GO-derived similarity graphs. It first derives refined gene embeddings through
  a co-expression-based GNN and separately processes perturbation embeddings via a
  GO graph to incorporate prior biological relationships, with the latter design enabling
  predictions for unSeen Perturbation Prediction. These embeddings are integrated
  by adding the aggregated perturbation signal to the gene representations and then
  decoded using gene-specific layers augmented by a cross-gene context module, ultimately
  reconstructing the post-perturbation transcriptomic profile. The model is trained
  end-to-end with a combined autofocus and direction-aware loss, and it can optionally
  quantify uncertainty through a Gaussian likelihood framework.
