Description: scDist is a statistical framework that uses linear mixed-effects models
  to estimate gene-level condition effects while accounting for individual and technical
  variability. In the model, baseline expression levels are first captured, and then
  a parameter representing the condition-induced change is estimated. The overall
  shift between conditions is quantified by computing the Euclidean distance between
  the condition-specific mean expression profiles - essentially, by taking the norm
  of the condition effect vector. This high-dimensional metric is then efficiently
  approximated in a lower-dimensional space via principal component analysis.
