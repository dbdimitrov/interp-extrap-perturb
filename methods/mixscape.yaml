Description: Mixscape aims to classify CRISPR-targeted cells into perturbed and not
  perturbed (escaping). To eachive that, Mixscape computes a local perturbation signature
  by subtracting each cell’s mRNA expression from the average of its k nearest NT
  (non-targeted) control neighbors. Differential expression testing between targeted
  and NT cells then identifies a set of DEGs that capture the perturbation response.
  These DEGs are used to define a perturbation vector-essentially, the average difference
  in expression between targeted and NT cells, which projects each cell’s DEG expression
  onto a single perturbation score. The Gaussian mixture model is applied to these
  perturbation scores, with one component fixed to match the NT distribution, while
  the other represents the perturbation effect. This model assigns probabilities that
  classify each targeted cell as either perturbed or escaping. Additionally, the authors
  propose visualisation with Linear Discriminant Analysis and UMAP, aiming to identify
  a low-dimensional subspace that maximally discriminates the mixscape-derived classes.
