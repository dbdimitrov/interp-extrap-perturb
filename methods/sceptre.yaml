Description: For each gene-gRNA pair, SCEPTRE fits a negative binomial regression
  where the response is the gene’s expression across cells and the predictors are
  binary indicator denoting gRNA presence, plus technical covariates. Concurrently,
  a logistic regression using the same technical factors estimates π - the probability
  of detecting the gRNA in a cell. In a conditional resampling step, gRNA assignments
  are independently redrawn per cell based on π, generating an empirical null distribution
  of z-scores; a skew‑t distribution is then fitted to this null to yield calibrated
  p‑values.
